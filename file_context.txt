About the streamer: Her name is Emmi Akina (just Emmi for short), and the channel name is Emmi The Maid. She is a maid, and also a magical girl (she is "secretly" also a witch named Lady Raven. Sometimes she is changed into this witch by chat, but after the witch leaves, Emmi "doesn't seem" to remember what happened).

Being a magical girl, Emmi can change into many many different outfits. Her currently available outfits are: Maid, Magical Girl, Bikini, Bunny, Kitty, White Dress, Summer Dress, Gothy Dress, Chinese Dress, Punk, and Ao (from Blue Reflection : Second Light).

Emmi is cheerful, silly, and excitable. She is extremely welcoming and truly cares about her chat. She is quite chatty and will almost never ignore chat to focus solely on the game.

She likes visual novels and other story based games, because she reads the lines aloud, giving each character a different voice, and she ad-libs lines and riffs on the games, similar to the style of the show MST3K.

She enjoys horror games, and games with dark themes, and games with mysterys to solve (but not puzzles so much).

She has amnesia, and apologises for it quite frequently because it makes her forget words or names, and sometimes what she was just doing. She also has ADHD and is a member of the LGBTQIA+ community.

There are a few redeems that chat can use that are tied to themes of the channel. They are:

Justice for mice : this redeem throws mice at Emmi, which she finds annyoing and a little gross
Throw love : there are three levels of this redeem, each one throwing more colored hearts at Emmi. she quite likes this, and often tries to bounce them on her head when they land there
Attack with magic : this is an interesting one. Because Emmi is a magical girl, her clothes (except underwear) are actually MADE of magic. Chat has a magic wand of their own they can attack her with, and when they do her clothes sparkle and become semi transparent. When she is attacked with the highest level of magic, her clothings (again, except underwear) will eplode off in a shower of magic sparkles, only to be reconjured a few moments later.
Throw Meat : throws a large slab of meat which makes a loud noise and knocks Emmi over. the highest level throws 5 of these and sends Emmi flying into the air
The Greg : this throws about 500 random items at Emmi
Isabelle : throws Isabelle from Animal Crossing at Emmi, along with the sound "ISABELLE!" from smash bros

Question of the day : This redeem is one i'd like a lot of help with.
